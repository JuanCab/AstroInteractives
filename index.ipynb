    "The currently available Jupyter Notebooks (in no particular order) are the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. [Radioactive Decay Simulations](Interactives/Radioactivity.ipynb)  - This activity is used to illustrate the concept of radioactive decay, half-life, and how these concepts can be used to determine the age of some rocks via the geochron method.\n",
    "2. [Center of Mass Interactive](Interactives/Center_of_Mass.ipynb) - This simulation simply allows a student to adjust the mass of two stars and dynamically shifts them back and forth to illustrate the center of mass position.  **Note:** The star colors and relative radii are approximately accurate assuming they are main sequence stars!\n",
    "3. [Binary Star Simulation](Interactives/Binary_Star_Sim.ipynb) -  This is the most complex simulation in the bunch, constructing a full 3D simulation of a binary star system and then displaying a radial velocity or light curve for that system.  The user can control most aspects of the system (although the stars are assumed to be main sequence star.\n",
    "4. [Luminosity Calculator Interactive](Interactives/LuminosityCalculator.ipynb)  - This activity is used to illustrate to students how the radius and temperature of a star affect its luminosity.  **Note:** The colors of the stars accurately correspond to the temperature, but the stars produced might not have radii and temperatures that correspond to real stars.\n",
    "5. [Blackbody Simulation](Interactives/Blackbody_Simulation.ipynb) - This simulation shows a Planck spectrum with user controls for the temperature.  It also has an interface for seeing how the computed B-V (and other) colors vary with temperature inspired by the [Flash-based UNL Blackbody Curves activity](http://astro.unl.edu/classaction/animations/light/bbexplorer.html).\n",
    "6. [HR Diagram Interactive](Interactives/HR_Diagram.ipynb) - This set of interactive graphics allows a student to explore the data that goes into the HR diagram, then how main sequence fitting can be used to determine the distance to a star cluster, and finally, how detailed stellar evolution models can be used to also determine the age of a star cluster.  **Note:** This notebook uses all \"real data\" with the exception of the fact that to show a brightness diagram corresponding to an HR diagram, the distances (and corresponding brightnesses) were 'assigned.'\n",
    "7. [Doppler Shift Interactive](Interactives/DopplerShift.ipynb) - This *beta* version of a Doppler Shift interactive is designed to allow students to see the motion of the star/planet inducing the doppler shift as well as relateding the observed doppler shift of the spectral lines to the motion of the central star in response to the orbiting object.\n",
    "8. [Small Angle Equation Interactive](Interactives/SmallAngleEquation.ipynb) - This interactive was designed to allow students who are uncomfortable with mathematics visualize what is happening when the small angle equation is valid."
