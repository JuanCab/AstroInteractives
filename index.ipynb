    "[*Astro Interactives*](https://juancab.github.io/AstroInteractives/) is a series of Jupyter Notebooks meant to provide \n",

    "The currently available Interactives are the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "### General Astronomy\n",
    "1. [Small Angle Approximation Interactive](Interactives/SmallAngleEquation.ipynb) - This interactive was designed to allow students who are uncomfortable with mathematics visualize what is happening when the small angle approximation is valid.\n",
    "2. [Flux vs.Luminosity Interactive](Interactives/FluxVsLuminositySimulation.ipynb) - This interactive is meant to be used in discussions of the concepts of flux/brightness, luminosity, and the inverse square law.\n",
    "3. [Doppler Shift Interactives](Interactives/DopplerShift.ipynb) - These Doppler Shift interactives are designed to allow students to first model simple Doppler Shift and then to model the more complicated time-varying Doppler Shift seen in binary star and exoplanetary systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Solar System and Planetary Astronomy\n",
    "1. [Radioactive Decay Interactives](Interactives/Radioactivity.ipynb)  - This pair of interactive plots is used to illustrate the concept of radioactive decay, half-life, and how these concepts can be used to determine the age of some rocks via the geochron method.\n",
    "2. [Exoplanet System Simulation Interactive](Interactives/Exoplanet_Sim.ipynb) -  This interactive contains a full 3D simulation of a star system containing a single Jovian exoplanet, including a radial velocity or light curve for that system.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Stellar Astronomy\n",
    "1. [Center of Mass Interactive](Interactives/Center_of_Mass.ipynb) - This interactive model simply allows a student to adjust the mass and separation of two stars and see the shifts of their orbits, illustrating the center of mass position.\n",
    "2. [Binary Star Simulation Interactive](Interactives/Binary_Star_Sim.ipynb) -  This interactive contains a full 3D simulation of a binary star system, including a radial velocity or light curve for that system.  The user can control most physical parameters of the system.\n",
    "3. [Luminosity Calculator Interactive](Interactives/LuminosityCalculator.ipynb)  - This interactive is used to illustrate to students how the radius and temperature of a star affect its luminosity.  The colors of the stars accurately correspond to the temperature, but the stars produced might not have radii and temperatures that correspond to real stars.\n",
    "4. [Blackbody Spectra Interactives](Interactives/Blackbody_Simulation.ipynb) - This set of interactive figures can be used to explore the properties of the Blackbody spectrum as applied to stars.  \n",
    "5. [HR Diagram Interactives](Interactives/HR_Diagram.ipynb) - This set of interactive plots allows a student to explore the data that goes into the HR diagram, then how main sequence fitting can be used to determine the distance to a star cluster, and finally, how detailed stellar evolution models can be used to also determine the age of a star cluster.\n"
