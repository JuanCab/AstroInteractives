    "### Running the interactives in Jupyter or Voila (Server-Side Execution)\n",
    "- All interactives run properly in *Jupyter* and *Voila* where a Jupyter server is running the code.  However, the animations may end up being \"laggy\" since the software is run on the server and the changes are then sent to the web browser, such that they can lag behind the user inputs.  Efforts have been made to optimize the code to avoid these problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Running the interactives in Voici (Client-Side Execution)\n",
    "- There are some issues when running them in *Voici* (where the code is converted to a standalone web app):\n",
    "  - This index notebook must be moved to be in the same directory as the remaining notebooks (inside the `interactives/` directory) for the links to work properly.  This is because Voici only supports converting single notebooks or entire directories, but not a nested directory structure.\n",
    "  - Interactives that rely on *bqplot* to have graphs that can respond to user clicks on the graph do not work (the graph updates, but doesn't trigger the other elements to update). This is a known issue with *Voici* and *bqplot* (documented in these issues: [bqplot/1647](https://github.com/bqplot/bqplot/issues/1647) and [voici/121](https://github.com/voila-dashboards/voici/issues/121)).  This problem affects the following interactives:\n",
    "    - **HR Diagram**: In interactive 2, moving the dots to indicate location of main sequence doesn't trigger corresponding changes in the brightness diagram.\n",
    "    - **Synthetic LV Diagram**: The rotational velocity and density graphs will respond to user drawing a new curve on them, but they don't inform the backend to update the other graphs.\n",
    "    - **Synthetic HI Spectra**: The rotational velocity and density graphs will respond to user drawing a new curve on them, but they don't inform the backend to update the other graphs.\n",
    "  - Otherwise, the interactives should work as expected in *Voici*!  This is testament to the work of the Voici and Jupyter-lite teams in porting Jupyter's capabilities into WebAssembly."
