    "The currently available Jupyter Notebooks (in no particular order) are the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. [Radioactive Decay Interactive](Interactives/radioactive_decay.ipynb) ([Launch in AppMode](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/JuanCab/AstroInteractives/master?urlpath=%2Fapps%2FInteractives%2Fradioactive_decay.ipynb))  - This activity is used to illustrate the concept of radioactive decay and half-life.\n",
    "2. [Radioactive Isochrones Interactive](Interactives/Isochrones.ipynb) ([Launch in AppMode](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/JuanCab/AstroInteractives/master?urlpath=%2Fapps%2FInteractives%2FIsochrones.ipynb))  - This activity is used to illustrate how radioactive dataing works using radioactive isochrones.  It is meant to be used after introducing the students to the concept of half-lives.\n",
    "3. [Center of Mass Interactive](Interactives/Center_of_Mass.ipynb) ([Launch in AppMode](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/JuanCab/AstroInteractives/master?urlpath=%2Fapps%2FInteractives%2FCenter_of_Mass.ipynb)) - **(WARNING: This interactive uses 3D widgets from *pythreejs*, may fail to work properly in AppMode.)**  This simulation simply allows a student to adjust the mass of two stars and dynamically shifts them back and forth to illustrate the center of mass position.  **Note:** The star colors and relative radii are approximately accurate assuming they are main sequence stars!\n",
    "4. [Luminosity Calculator Interactive](Interactives/LuminosityCalculator.ipynb) ([Launch in AppMode)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/JuanCab/AstroInteractives/master?urlpath=%2Fapps%2FInteractives%2FLuminosityCalculator.ipynb))  - **(WARNING: This interactive uses 3D widgets from *pythreejs*, may fail to work properly in AppMode.)** This activity is used to illustrate to students how the radius and temperature of a star affect its luminosity.  **Note:** The colors of the stars accurately correspond to the temperature, but the stars produced might not have radii and temperatures that correspond to real stars.\n",
    "5. [Blackbody Simulation](Interactives/BlackbodySimulation.ipynb) ([Launch in AppMode](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/JuanCab/AstroInteractives/master?urlpath=%2Fapps%2FInteractives%2FBlackbodySimulation.ipynb)) - This simulation shows a Planck spectrum with user controls for the temperature.  We eventually hope to add B-V color estimation, similar to the [Flash-based UNL Blackbody Curves activity](http://astro.unl.edu/classaction/animations/light/bbexplorer.html)\n",
    "6. [HR Diagram Interactive](Interactives/Interactive_HR_Diagram.ipynb) ([Launch in AppMode](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/JuanCab/AstroInteractives/master?urlpath=%2Fapps%2FInteractives%2FInteractive_HR_Diagram.ipynb)) - This set of interactive graphics allows a student to explore the data that goes into the HR diagram, then how main sequence fitting can be used to determine the distance to a star cluster, and finally, how detailed stellar evolution models can be used to also determine the age of a star cluster.  **Note:** This notebook uses all \"real data\" with the exception of the fact that to show a brightness diagram corresponding to an HR diagram, the distances (and corresponding brightnesses) were 'assigned.'"
