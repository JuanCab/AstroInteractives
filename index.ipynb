    "The currently available Jupyter Notebooks (in no particular order) are the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. [Radioactive Decay Simulations](Interactives/Radioactive_Sims.ipynb)  - This activity is used to illustrate the concept of radioactive decay, half-life, and how these concepts can be used to determine the age of some rocks via the geochron method.\n",
    "2. [Center of Mass Interactive](Interactives/Center_of_Mass.ipynb) - This simulation simply allows a student to adjust the mass of two stars and dynamically shifts them back and forth to illustrate the center of mass position.  **Note:** The star colors and relative radii are approximately accurate assuming they are main sequence stars!\n",
    "3. [Binary Star Simulation](Interactives/Binary_Star_Sim.ipynb) -  This is the most complex simulation in the bunch, constructing a full 3D simulation of a binary star system and then displaying a radial velocity or light curve for that system.  The user can control most aspects of the system (although the stars are assumed to be main sequence star.\n",
    "4. [Luminosity Calculator Interactive](Interactives/LuminosityCalculator.ipynb)  - This activity is used to illustrate to students how the radius and temperature of a star affect its luminosity.  **Note:** The colors of the stars accurately correspond to the temperature, but the stars produced might not have radii and temperatures that correspond to real stars.\n",
    "5. [Blackbody Simulation](Interactives/Blackbody_Simulation.ipynb) - This simulation shows a Planck spectrum with user controls for the temperature.  It also has an interface for seeing how the computed B-V (and other) colors vary with temperature inspired by the [Flash-based UNL Blackbody Curves activity](http://astro.unl.edu/classaction/animations/light/bbexplorer.html).\n",
    "6. [HR Diagram Interactive](Interactives/HR_Diagram.ipynb) - This set of interactive graphics allows a student to explore the data that goes into the HR diagram, then how main sequence fitting can be used to determine the distance to a star cluster, and finally, how detailed stellar evolution models can be used to also determine the age of a star cluster.  **Note:** This notebook uses all \"real data\" with the exception of the fact that to show a brightness diagram corresponding to an HR diagram, the distances (and corresponding brightnesses) were 'assigned.'"
