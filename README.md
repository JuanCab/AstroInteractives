Astro Interactives
==================

*Astro Interactives* is a series of Jupyter Notebooks meant to provide 
interactive demos and simulations for introductory astronomy courses.  These notebooks were initially developed by 
- Juan Cabanela (Professor for Physics and Astronomy at Minnesota State University Moorhead)
- Andrew Louwagie Gordon (Student at Minnesota State University Moorhead)
- Sam Holen (Student at Minnesota State University Moorhead)

This software is provide "as-is" and may contain bugs/errors that could  mis-represent astronomical reality.  You use this software at your own risk!

Goals
-----

-   Provide a freely downloadable set of Jupyter Notebooks that can be executed for use in introductory Astornomy labs and lecture activities to illustrate astronomical concepts.

Getting Started
---------------

### Try it online with [Binder](http://mybinder.org/)

[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/JuanCab/AstroInteractives/master?filepath=index.ipynb)

### Dependencies

This package depends on the following packages:

- `ipywidgets` (version >= 7.2.0)
- `appmode` (This allows the Jupyter notebook to run as an app)
- `bqplot`
- `matplotlib`

which in turn depends on

- `traitlets` (version >= 4.3.0)
- `traittypes`
- `numpy`
- `pandas`
